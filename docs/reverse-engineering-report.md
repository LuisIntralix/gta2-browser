# GTA2 Reverse Engineering — State of the Art (research date: 12 October 2026)

> **Pinned audit now available:** [gta2_re build, gaps and revised budget](gta2-re-build-audit-2026-10-12.md)
> records 3,400 MATCH markers, 21 WIPs and 9 CRT-wrapper STUBs at revision
> `02de8be`, successful upstream function checks, and an isolated browser math

Scope: what the community knows about GTA2's internals (DMA Design / Rockstar, PC/PSX/Dreamcast, Oct 1999), who documented it, and what tooling exists. Sources are cited inline. Compiled from live web research; all dates below are as published.

## 1. Documented file formats

Note on terminology: the tile/graphics archive is `.STY` ("style"), not STL — there is no `.stl` in GTA2. Map/level files are `.gmp`.

| Format | What it is | Documentation status | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GMP** (.gmp) | Map/level: 256×256×8 `block_info` cube, zones, map objects, lights, tile animation, routefinder junction list | **Fully documented by an official DMA Design internal spec** ("GBH Map Format", ~13 pages; header `"GBMP"`, version 500; chunk types UMAP/CMAP/DMAP/ZONE/MOBJ/PSXM/ANIM/LGHT/RGEN; CMAP = 16-bit, DMAP = 32-bit compression with hidden-surface removal). Mirrored by GTAMP; also on XentaxWiki. Forum research identifies **Colin MacDonald** as the author of the original `GTA2 Map format.doc` | [GTAMP GMP format](https://gtamp.com/gta2/gta2-gmp-map-file-format/), [XentaxWiki GMP](https://wiki.xentax.spektr.name/index.php/GTA_Series_GMP), [GTAMP authorship note](https://gtamp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=11568) |
| **STY** (.sty) | Style/graphics archive: palettes (PALX/PPAL/PALB), 64×64 tiles, sprites, deltas, fonts, car info (CARI), map object info (OBJI), PSX tiles, car recycling | **Fully documented by official DMA spec** ("GBH Style Format", version 600; same chunk system as GMP) mirrored on GTAMP; plus a plain-language community walkthrough (ModDB "GTA2 Editing Compendium", 2023). Delta animations (DELS/DELX) remain the fiddliest part | [GTAMP STY format](https://gtamp.com/gta2/gta2-style-sty-graphics-file-format/), [ModDB compendium](https://www.moddb.com/games/grand-theft-auto-2/tutorials/gta2-editing-compendium) |
| **Mission scripts** (.mis → `miss2.exe` → .scr binary) | Proprietary "GTA2script" language; multiscript system (level script + mission scripts) | **Both source language and binary format fully understood.** DMA officially released the compiler `miss2.exe` + 105-page manual + Industrial-district .mis sources on 23 Dec 1999 under an **MIT licence** ([GTA Wiki](https://gta.wiki/w/GTA2script_Compiler)). The binary `.scr` opcode format was reverse-engineered by T.M./Vike (SCR Decompiler, full command list, ~447 opcodes) and perfected by **Valps** — as of Nov 2024 the decompiler produces **recompilable .mis files for all three districts**, including fully decoded IF/WHILE/AND/OR/ELSE semantics (including the compiler's "lefty-form" bug) and a decomp.me scratch of gta2.exe's IF_JUMP handler | [GTAMP SCR decompiler thread](https://gtamp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=447), [IF/WHILE analysis](https://gtamp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?style=1&t=1393), [GTAForums "SCR decompiler finally 100% functional"](https://gtaforums.com/topic/999466-scr-decompiler-finally-100-functional/), [WikiGTA scripting manual](https://en.wikigta.org/wiki/Scripting_manual_(GTA2)), [Project Cerbera scripting page](https://projectcerbera.com/gta/2/tutorials/scripting) |
| **Audio** (SFX.RAW + SFX.SDT, per district: bil/ste/wil) | `.sdt` = 24-byte-per-entry directory (offset, size, sample rate, loop points); `.raw` = headerless 16-bit mono PCM | Fully documented on GTAMods Wiki (incl. exact WAV header template); radio (GTAudio) and vocals ship as plain WAV. Tools: GTA Wave 4.0 (2002), ermaccer's RockstarAudioTool | [GTAMods Wiki SFX](https://gtamods.com/wiki/SFX), [Grand Theft Wiki SFX](https://www.grandtheftwiki.com/SFX), [RockstarAudioTool](https://github.com/ermaccer/RockstarAudioTool) |
| **Other data files** | GCI (car handling), GXT/FXT (text), MMP (multiplayer map manifest), SVG (saves), REP (replays), d3ddll.dll / DmaVideo.dll (renderer helper DLLs) | Saves documented on GTAForums (2017, header/stats/weapons/respect layout); memory-address documentation for saves/trainers on GTAMP (t=700); **d3ddll and DmaVideo have been fully reimplemented in C++** by the gta2_re team ("GTA2Hax") | [GTAForums save format](https://gtaforums.com/topic/891744-save-file-format-documentation/), [GTAMP memory addresses](https://gtamp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?style=1&t=700), [gta2_re summary](https://gtamp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1424) |
| **Official bundle** | `gta2formats.zip` on GTAMP = the original DMA GMP + STY technical docs | The single most authoritative reference; hosted alongside the tools | [GTAMP tools page](https://gtamp.com/gta2/tools/) |

**Completeness verdict:** the data-side formats (GMP, STY, audio, GXT/GCI/MMP) are essentially completely documented — unusually, from *official* documentation that DMA released publicly. The executable side (opcode interpreter, AI, physics) is being recovered by the decompilation project (§3).

## 2. Community modding ecosystem

**Hub:** [GTAMP.com](https://gtamp.com/gta2/) (run by Sektor) — main site, [tools page](https://gtamp.com/gta2/tools/), [forum](https://gtamp.com/forum/), and Discord. It is unambiguously the centre of the GTA2 modding world.

**How active:** **Still alive in 2026.** The forum front page showed new posts dated 10–11 October 2026 ("New GTA2 Map Editor" by B-$hep with trubetz/valps/The_Loonies; "official GTA2 Map Editor patches"; "Essential mods for GTA2 unofficial v11.44?"). Game Hunter's changelog shows releases 2023, 2024, and 24 June 2025 (v1.5993) ([changelog.txt](https://gtamp.com/GTA2/changelog.txt)). The golden era was ~2009–2015; activity resurged strongly from ~2021 onwards, driven by the decompilation project.

**Key community tooling:**

- **GTA2 v11.44 "unofficial" executable** — Vike the Hube's continuous patch series (11.00→11.44) applied *by disassembly* to the game: multiplayer desync fixes, windowed mode, Windows 8/10/11 compatibility, replay improvements, traffic-flow fixes, script-command hardening. Distributed via [gtamp.com/gta2](https://gtamp.com/gta2/) with a [full changelog](https://gtamp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=73). Works on Windows 11.
- **GTA2 Game Hunter** (Sektor) — IRC-based multiplayer lobby/matchmaking with automatic map download (`gta2://` protocol), actively maintained into 2025.
- **Map editors** — official DMA GTA2 Map Editor (with community white-tile/crash fixes); **"New GTA2 Map Editor"** by B-$hep, in active development October 2026 ([forum](https://gtamp.com/forum/index.php)); Epic GTA2 Map Editor (T.M.) — map viewer, zone editor, script decompiler.
- **Script tools** — official `gta2script` kit (miss2.exe + docs + Industrial .mis sources); **GTA2 ScriptPad** (B-$hep, editor + compiler front-end); mispad (Jernej); **SCR decompiler** (T.M./Valps, 100% round-trip since 2024).
- **Graphics/audio** — GTA2 STY Tool (Jernej), GTA2 File Editor (Stephen Dawkins et al.), GTA Wave 4.0, TXT2GTA2.
- **Utilities** — GTA2_svge save editor (Ishani/Harry Denholm), Zone Editor, cmp2gmp (GTA1→GTA2 maps), INI2MIS, replay chat viewer, GXT editor.
- **Runtime mods (2025–2026)** — Seuko mod menu ([izawartka/gta2-seuko-mod](https://github.com/izawartka/gta2-seuko-mod)), GTA2 Radar mod for v11.44 ([forum, July 2026](https://gtamp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1443), [GitHub](https://github.com/r3538987/gta2-radar-mod)), FrontendFix, widescreen fix for 9.6 (fusionfix.io/wfp#gta2).

**Related wikis:** [WikiGTA](https://en.wikigta.org/wiki/Scripting_manual_(GTA2)) (scripting manual, script compiler), [GTAMods Wiki](https://gtamods.com/wiki/SFX) (file formats; SFX page updated Feb 2025), [XentaxWiki](https://wiki.xentax.spektr.name/index.php/GTA_Series_GMP), [GTA Wiki](https://gta.wiki/w/GTA2script_Compiler). [Project Cerbera](https://projectcerbera.com/gta/2/tutorials/scripting) (BenMillard) hosts polished GTA2 tutorials. GTAForums' GTA 2 board still sees tooling threads (e.g. SCR decompiler, Nov 2024).

**Spam warning:** several 2026 repos matching "gta2 trainer/mod menu 2026" (e.g. `btshahraag20/gta2-memory-master`, `heeeet111/gta2-seuko-vice-edition`) are SEO-bait mirrors with recycled code and no provenance — treat as untrusted; get mod menus from the gtamp-linked originals.

**Legal posture:** the major projects require the user's own copy of the game and ship no assets (havoc2 and OpenGTA2 state this explicitly; gta2_re distributes decompiled/rewritten code + documentation, i.e. no Rockstar assets). Rockstar/Take-Two still own the copyright and have a DMCA history with reverse-engineered GTA code (the 2021 GTA III/Vice City RE takedown-and-restore saga — [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/github-reverses-takedown-of-reverse-engineered-gta-source-code/)), so licence hygiene (MIT, no assets) is the community norm.

## 4. Original developers, source availability, leaks

- **No public source leak for GTA2 exists.** Unlike GTA III/VC (reverse-engineered) or GTA V (leaked), GTA2's original source has never leaked or been released. A [2006 GTAForums petition](https://gtaforums.com/topic/243222-petition-to-release-gta1gta2-source-code/) to release the GTA1/GTA2 sources (supported by a former DMA dev) went nowhere; the community consensus there (B-$hep): the 2004 Rockstar Classics freeware re-release was **recompiled from surviving source (v9.6F, MSVC 7.0, with debug info)** — the retail 1999 exe was MSVC 5.1/6.0 — and the Russian publisher BUKA's 10.1/10.3 builds were compiled from a different (`c:\gbh\coop101release`) source tree, so complete, current sources may be lost or scattered.
- **What DMA legitimately gave the community:** the mission-script compiler (`miss2.exe`, MIT-licensed 23 Dec 1999, with a 105-page manual and Industrial-district mission sources — [GTA Wiki](https://gta.wiki/w/GTA2script_Compiler)), the official GMP/STY format docs ([gta2formats.zip](https://gtamp.com/gta2/tools/)), and the official map editor. This is why data-format knowledge is so complete.
- **Named people behind the internals:** lead programmer **Keith R. Hamilton** ([Wikipedia credits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_2)); the format docs' metadata points to **Colin MacDonald** (GMP/map format) and **Keith Hamilton** (CDS.doc) ([forum discussion](https://gtamp.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=11568)); designers Billy Thomson/Stephen Banks; directors Jim Woods/David Jones. **Mike Dailly** (GTA1) has published development history of the shared Race'n'Chase lineage. An ex-DMA dev also uploaded original uncompressed GTA2 music to YouTube in 2024 ([GTAForums thread](https://gtaforums.com/topic/999226-ex-dma-dev-uploading-original-uncut-and-uncompressed-gta-2-music-tracks-onto-youtube/)).
- **Preserved material:** a September 1999 PSX prototype ("Hardwood Heroes" title screen) on archive.org ([GTAForums](https://gtaforums.com/topic/970832-prototype-build-of-gta2-sep1999/)) and an April 2000 Dreamcast prototype at [Hidden Palace](https://hiddenpalace.org/Grand_Theft_Auto_2_(Apr_7,_2000_prototype)).
- **Understood vs unknown:** data formats — fully understood. Script VM — fully understood (opcodes, threads, compiler quirks, working decompiler). Executable — roughly two-thirds matched by the decomp project (game loop, frontend, HUD, map rendering, script engine, car/ped classes largely mapped; sound backend and boot-to-gameplay incomplete as of the last public summary). Multiplayer/netcode — understood well enough that community patches fixed desyncs at the source level. PSX-specific format deltas — partially supported (map compressor yes; most PC editors no).

## Relevance to your copy of the game

Your `GTA2INSTALLER.exe` (Rockstar Classics freeware, Dec 2004) is the v9.6F build — the same input the tooling ecosystem standardised on: OpenGTA2 and sp00nznet's recompilation download and unpack exactly this installer; gta2-rtx-remix is tested against v9.6 and v11.44; Sektor's memory-address docs cover both. Two practical notes from the research: (1) the freeware `gta2.exe` is **TAC-packed in every known distribution**, which blocks naive static unpacking — runtime dumping is required, which is why the gta2_re decompilation targets the 10.5 freeloader exe instead; (2) for modding rather than RE, the community standard is installing the unofficial **v11.44** alongside it.

---

## Bottom line

GTA2 is in unusually good shape for a 27-year-old game: its data formats are completely documented (partly from *official* DMA documentation), its script language has a fully working compiler *and* a 100%-functional decompiler since 2024, and an active four-person team has matched over two-thirds of the executable in an RE3-style decompilation as of October 2026 — with no original source ever leaked or released, so all exe knowledge comes from disciplined disassembly. The modding community on gtamp.com is small but demonstrably alive (patches, a new map editor, RTX path tracing and a multiplayer lobby all updated in 2025–26). If your project needs deep engine work, gta2_re + the GTA2 RE Hub are the vehicles to join or build on; for content modding, the toolchain is already mature end-to-end.
